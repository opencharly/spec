	//
	// This test discriminates BOTH properties, and getting there took two wrong fixtures:
	//   - the reap existing at all — drop the Kill/Wait block and the child survives;
	//   - the reap ORDER — reverse it and this times out instead of returning in ~4ms.
	//
	// The second only became observable once the fixture stopped self-terminating. With
	// `sleep 30` it passed after 30s; with `cat` it passed in 4ms, because EOF arrives
	// regardless of order. Both made the ordering invisible, and the `cat` result briefly
	// convinced me the ordering did not matter at all.
	// The fixture must NOT terminate on its own — that is the probe this test failed twice.
	// `sleep 30` self-terminates on its own deadline; `cat` self-terminates on EOF, and EOF
	// arrives regardless of reap order because exec.Cmd.Start's deferred closeDescriptors
	// closes save's write end when Start fails. Either fixture makes the ORDER unobservable.
	//
	// This one reads from /dev/null and loops forever: it ignores the pipe, so no EOF can
	// reach it, and it has no internal deadline. Now Kill-then-Wait returns promptly while

	// so the pid is FREE — signalling it is an unscoped kill by a stale identifier, exactly
	// what the comment further down forbids, widened from one process to a group. The

	// the run died on `go test`'s default ten-minute timeout with a goroutine dump instead

	// which the test binary need not outlive — measured: five of six failing runs leaked);
	// round 6's was delivered and confirmed, but CONFIRMED IT WRONG, reporting a leak on a
	// genuine regression run that had not happened.
	//
	// That third failure was caused by the confirmation itself, so this round removes it
	// rather than correcting it. SIGKILL to a process group is uncatchable: the kernel has
	// delivered it by the time kill(2) returns, so DELIVERY IS DEATH and there is nothing to
	// poll for. The poll could only ever restate what the syscall already guaranteed — and
	// because syscall.Kill(pid, 0) asks "is there a process-table ENTRY", not "is anything
	// RUNNING", it read the resulting zombie as a live shell and spun its whole deadline. In
	// this perturbation nothing Waits the child (that IS the regression), so the entry
	// necessarily survives as Z until the binary exits. A zombie is not an immortal shell.
