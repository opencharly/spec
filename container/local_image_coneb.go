//     content-derived label (ai.opencharly.version), because a short name refers to a box's
//     content, not to whatever was compiled most recently.
//   - buildOrder answers "which of these was BUILT most recently". Its primary key is creation
//     time, the only recency key total over the tags charly mints.
//
// RefuseIfStale exists precisely because those two answers can disagree: an image built from a
// differently-versioned source tree outranks a newer build on content, and certifying it is the
// defect this whole cutover removes. Sharing one comparator made cands[0] identically the maximum
// buildOrder returns, so NewestBuildRef == Ref always and the guard became a tautology — green,
// because every refusal test at the time used the two-family split where the scanned set is wider.
// TestResolveBuiltImageRef_SingleFamilyStaleElectionRefuses is the gate for that.
//
// What they DO share is the deterministic tail, and sharing it is the real R3 here: when every
// meaningful key ties, both must land on the SAME candidate, or the two orderings name different
