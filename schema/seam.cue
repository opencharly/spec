// CUE schema for the COMMAND-time host↔plugin seam wire types (P10). A
// compiled-in command plugin (candy/plugin-vm's command:vm leg) owns its CLI
// handlers but cannot LoadUnified, hold the deploy ledger, or run the VM-disk
// build engine — those are core Mechanisms a plugin (a separate module importing
// only sdk) reaches over the in-proc reverse channel. The config READ (the
// "config-resolve" seam) + the ledger write (candy/plugin-vm/vm_host_persist.go)
// and the VM-disk build (candy/plugin-vm/vm_build_resolve.go) moved PLUGIN-SIDE —
// the former config-resolve / config-persist / vm-build HostBuilds are DELETED.
// Each action noun is CLASS-GENERIC (never a substrate word — the F11 uniform-API
// gate); pod (P11) + bundle (P13) reuse the same seams.
//
// Package-less; concatenated into the spec compilation unit. NOT authoring kinds
// (never in #Node/#Op) — pure generated wire types, single-sourced here so
// `task cue:gen` produces the Go structs (WIRE TYPES ARE CUE-SOURCED WITHOUT
// EXCEPTION, CLAUDE.md SDD). Fields that carry a hand-written runtime type with
// NO CUE def (*ResolvedVm, map[string]*ResolvedResource) travel as opaque
// bytes/RawBody envelopes the consumer marshals/unmarshals at the boundary (the
// #ParsedNode `body: bytes @go(...,type=RawBody)` idiom); fields whose type HAS a
// CUE def reference it directly (#Deploy is fully generated; #VmDeployState is a
// def with a hand materialization, referenced via @go(...,type=*VmDeployState) —
// the same shape #Deploy.vm_state uses). @go names match the Go field names the
// host + plugin consumers reference so the CUE-source flip is call-site-invisible.

// #PodDisposableRequest asks the host whether a per-host POD deploy overlay entry is disposable
// (K5-U2/3). This is the ONE AI-harness check-project fact the resolved-project envelope cannot
// carry: the harness's iterate sandbox is an OPERATOR-provisioned per-host deploy (`charly bundle
// add <sandbox> <ref> --disposable`), so its disposability lives in the per-host overlay
// (LoadBundleConfig → ~/.config/charly/charly.yml), NOT the project charly.yml the resolved-project
// envelope projects (Mode Purity keeps the overlay out of the build-mode projection). The overlay
// read needs the core loader a plugin cannot import, and no deploy/status provider serves it, so it
// rides this THIN retained host seam. The host returns Bundle[Name].IsDisposable() (false when the
// sandbox has no entry — the harness then skips its fresh-per-run restart). Class-generic action

// distinction #PodDisposableRequest documents). Unlike #PodDisposableRequest (a single overlay
// BIT), several pod-lifecycle resolvers need CROSS-DEPLOYMENT visibility (deploykit.BundleConfig's
// GlobalEnvForImage/OccupiedHostPorts/DeployedContainerNames all read OTHER deploys' entries, not
// just the caller's own), so a single-field extraction can't serve them — the host returns the
// WHOLE marshaled *deploykit.BundleConfig and the plugin calls the SAME already-portable
// deploykit methods locally. Re-fetched on EVERY call (no caching): the ledger can change between
// invocations (an intervening `charly config`), and PrepareVenue-time data is stale by the time

// the plugin-side agent grader wiring, gated by NoAgent/Agent/Timeout), scoped by Tag/Strict.

//     hostBuildResolvedProject already computed to BUILD the envelope in the first place — no

// Exactly one of {box_view, box_ref, candy_ref-alone} is set, OR the ADD-CANDY-ON-BOX pair

// ResolveTarget proxy (unified_targets.go) constructs this per call from data alone — it never
// holds a *grpcProvider or any core-private registry object, so the type is free to live
// entirely on the wire. `word` is the resolved deploy-substrate provider word (e.g. "pod"/"vm"/
// "local"/"k8s"/"android") the plugin dispatches the ACTUAL substrate leg to, via its own
// sdk.Executor.InvokeProvider — core never talks to the substrate provider directly once this
// lands. `has_lifecycle` is the ONE piece of substrate metadata core must resolve itself (the
// registered-provider's own `lifecycle` flag lives on the core-private *grpcProvider) — it gates
// whether Start/Stop/Status/Logs/Shell/Attach/Rebuild are even valid for this substrate
// (mirroring the former ErrNotSupportedOnExternal branches) AND whether the Q1 arbiter bracket
// applies to Start/Stop — `has_plan` is that DIFFERENT, narrower boolean (K4-exit, FLOOR-SLIM-
// proper Unit-8): core still computes it (lifecycleStartPlanHooks[word]/lifecycleStopPlanHooks[word]
// presence, pod_lifecycle_dispatch.go, unmoved) and now THREADS it on the wire instead of bracketing
// the dispatch call itself — command:bundle's handleLifecycleSimple owns the bracket call, by
// InvokeProvider("verb","arbiter") peer dispatch (the "arbiter-bracket-*" HostBuild seams are
// DELETED, K-wave 2 cone R2 bank E; the CHARLY_PREEMPT_LEASE os.Setenv/os.Getenv
// nested-subprocess-inheritance property lives in candy/plugin-preempt's invokeArbiter + the
// plugin-bundle bracket, both compiled-in sharing the host process). `node` is the dispatch-merged BundleNode
// (nil for a ref-based deploy with no charly.yml entry) — required when has_plan is true (the claim
// fields live on it). `plans_json` carries []InstallPlanView
// for Add/Update. `opts_json` carries the op-specific opts struct as an opaque envelope (the
// zero-value-safe pattern every #Pod*Opts request already uses) — kept opaque rather than one
// field per opts type so a NEW deploy verb never needs a NEW CUE field, only a new decode
