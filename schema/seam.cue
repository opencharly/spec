// "config-resolve"), ledger writes → HostBuild("config-persist"), VM-disk build →
// HostBuild("vm-build"). Each action noun is CLASS-GENERIC (never a substrate
// word — the F11 uniform-API gate); pod (P11) + bundle (P13) reuse the same seams.
//
// Package-less; concatenated into the spec compilation unit. NOT authoring kinds
// (never in #Node/#Op) — pure generated wire types, single-sourced here so
// `task cue:gen` produces the Go structs (WIRE TYPES ARE CUE-SOURCED WITHOUT
// EXCEPTION, CLAUDE.md SDD). Fields that carry a hand-written runtime type with
// NO CUE def (*ResolvedVm, map[string]*ResolvedResource) travel as opaque
// bytes/RawBody envelopes the consumer marshals/unmarshals at the boundary (the
// #ParsedNode `body: bytes @go(...,type=RawBody)` idiom); fields whose type HAS a
// CUE def reference it directly (#Deploy is fully generated; #VmDeployState is a
// def with a hand materialization, referenced via @go(...,type=*VmDeployState) —
// the same shape #Deploy.vm_state uses). @go names match the Go field names the
// host + plugin consumers reference so the CUE-source flip is call-site-invisible.

// #ConfigResolveRequest asks the host to resolve the project config for one
// entity. Entity is the resolved entity name (a kind:vm entity for command:vm;
// empty resolves the project-wide enumeration in VmEntities). Dir is the project

// VmJSON is the resolved vm value envelope (uf.VM[entity] via resolveVmViaPlugin,
// #Vm-defaulted host-side), ResourcesJSON the resolved resource map
// (uf.resolveResources() — drives GPU auto-allocation) — both opaque JSON of a
// hand-written runtime type with no CUE def. Claimant + ClaimantNode carry the
// exclusive-resource claimant (lookupVMClaimant) the handler acquires a preempt
// lease for. VmBackend/BuildEngine/RunEngine are the runtime-settings fields
// (ResolveRuntime) the create/build pipeline reads; VmBackend also feeds the

// vm-lifecycle move, coneB-vmlifecycle — the resolved Backend value itself no
// longer crosses the wire; the plugin computes it from VmBackend + its own
// "deploy-entity-resolve" call). VmState is the entity's persisted
// deploy-ledger runtime state (instance-id, ssh_port, disk path) — the READ
// half of the ledger dep (loadDeployConfigForRead → LookupKey "vm:<entity>")
// so the plugin reuses the persisted auto-port + regenerates the seed ISO
// without holding the deploy-config lock. VmEntities is the project's

// registry VerbResolver, exactly as command:vm forwards `vm build` to
// HostBuild("vm-build"). The action noun "check-run" is class-generic (F11).
//
// Mode selects the run shape (discriminated union): "box" — a pure-box run against a
// disposable container built from Image (RunModeBox, build-scope steps only, the CheckBoxCmd
// engine); "live" — a full-stack run against a running deployment resolved by Name (the host
// classifies vm/pod/local/group internally, so the plugin stays kind-blind), applying the
// Instance/Section/Filter selectors; "feature-box" / "feature-live" — the ADE acceptance run

// the host-side agent grader wiring, gated by NoAgent/Agent/Timeout), scoped by Tag/Strict.
// Dir is the project dir (empty → the host uses its own cwd), matching LoadUnified(dir).

// (FormatStepResults*) with byte-parity across every --format. A live `cue exp
// gengotypes` spike (P12) proved kit.CheckResult AS A WHOLE is genuinely inexpressible in
// CUE — its engine-internal `DeadlineExceeded bool json:"-"` field has no gengotypes
// construct — but confirmed the REST of the type (Op/Verb/Status/Message/Elapsed/
// Attempts/TotalElapsed/CapturedValue) generates faithfully. FLOOR-SLIM Unit 4 acted on
// that finding: #CheckResult (checkresult.cue) is the CUE-sourced base (→ spec.CheckResult),

// returns []InstallPlanView. The host re-materializes []*InstallPlan from the views via
// deploykit.PlanFromView.
//
//   - BOX-VIEW selection (an already-resolved base image, ctx!=nil): box_view + order are

//   - CANDY selection (compileStandaloneCandySelection, the target:local/vm standalone-candy
//     shape, K4 unit B candy-half): candy_ref is set — the plugin resolves the candy key + topo
//     order itself from its own envelope (deploykit.ResolveCandyOrder over rp.CandyModels,
//     already pure) and builds ITS OWN synthetic box (vmshared.DetectHostDistro/DetectHostGlibc
//     for a host target — already sdk-portable; the kind:vm provider's own OpResolve leg for a
//     vm target, mirroring the kind:local OpResolve reuse in node_resolve.go's
//     lookupLocalTemplate, K4 unit A).
//   - BOX-REF selection (compileBoxSelection, the primary pod/k8s image shape, K4 unit B
//     box-half): box_ref is set — the plugin reads rp.Boxes[box_ref] (the SAME ResolvedBoxView
//     hostBuildResolvedProject already computed to BUILD the envelope in the first place — no
//     re-derivation, R3) directly via deploykit.NewSpecResolvedBox, and resolves the candy topo
//     order itself from img.Candy over rp.CandyModels (deploykit.ResolveCandyOrder, same as the
//     CANDY shape).
//
// Exactly one of {box_view, box_ref, candy_ref-alone} is set, OR the ADD-CANDY-ON-BOX pair
// (candy_ref + base_box_ref) together. Neither CANDY nor BOX-REF needs
// LoadUnified or the provider-CONNECT registry (verified live, K4 unit B: candy/plugin-bundle's
// own ALREADY-EXISTING preresolveBuilderContexts, called unconditionally for every OpCompile,
// already S2-lazy-connects any externalized builder the resolved order+img trigger via
// exec.InvokeProvider — an exhaustive repo grep found zero target:local/vm or pod/k8s deploy

// whether Start/Stop/Status/Logs/Shell/Attach/Rebuild are even valid for this substrate
