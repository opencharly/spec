				ExecutorService — the HOST-SERVED reverse channel (E3b). A provider's live
				DeployExecutor (shell/SSH on the venue) cannot cross the process boundary, so an
				OUT-OF-PROCESS provider drives it by calling BACK to the host: the host serves this
				service on the go-plugin GRPCBroker, passes its broker id in
				InvokeRequest.executor_broker_id, and the plugin dials that id to run ops against the
				real venue. Built-in providers use the typed DeployExecutor directly (no wire).
				RunSystem/RunUser/Venue are the deploy/step/builder legs (fire-a-script, error-only);
				PutFile is the deploy/step file-PLACEMENT leg — an out-of-process deploy/step plugin
				that EXECUTES an InstallPlan's steps pushes file content (units, env.d, the charly
				binary, builder artifacts) onto the venue, the kit.Executor.PutFile surface made
				wire-backed (the host materializes the carried bytes to a temp file, then delegates
				to the live DeployExecutor.PutFile). RunCapture/GetFile are the CHECK-VERB legs — an
				out-of-process exec-based check verb (record — and dbus/wl when they externalize)
				probes the live container by capturing stdout/stderr/exit or pulling a venue file (a
				screenshot/recording artifact), the kit.Executor.RunCapture/GetFile surface made
				wire-backed.

				RunHostStep is the HOST-ENGINE channel (the generalization of the former F3 build channel): the
				irreducible host machinery — the build ENGINE (Generator / OCITarget / ResolveBox /
				podman / BuilderRun / the injected EnsureImage closure / makepkg), the DistroConfig package-template
				render, the in-proc provider registry (ProvisionActor act verbs), and the broker that
				dispatches ANOTHER plugin — STAYS in charly's core (package main — it cannot move into
				the leaf plugin/kit package without dragging package main in). So an OUT-OF-PROCESS
				deploy/step plugin walking an InstallPlan that hits one of the HOST-ENGINE step kinds —
				BuilderStep (pixi/npm/cargo/aur), LocalPkgInstallStep (makepkg + pacman/dnf/apt),
				SystemPackagesStep (the format's host install template, rendered from the project
				DistroConfig), an act-verb OpStep (a `run: plugin: <verb>` whose builtin ProvisionActor
				shell needs the in-proc registry), or an ExternalPluginStep (a `run: plugin: <verb>`
				served by ANOTHER out-of-process plugin, dispatched over a NESTED reverse channel) —
				dials BACK to RunHostStep. The host reconstructs the step from its serializable view,
				runs the EXISTING in-core machinery on the host, applies the effect onto the venue via
				the EXISTING executor (the plugin's own venue, which the host already holds for this
				Invoke), and returns the step's recorded ReverseOps so the plugin folds them into its
				DeployReply (record-and-replay teardown). Every OTHER (plugin-renderable) step kind the
				plugin EXECUTES itself via the RunSystem/RunUser/PutFile legs — reaching RunHostStep
				with one of those is a plugin-walk bug. The plugin owns the plan WALK ordering; the host
				owns the host ENGINE.
