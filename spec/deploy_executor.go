// deploy_executor.go — the InstallPlan IR's EXECUTION contract (P4 "IR E-envelope"):
// the DeployExecutor interface every host-side executor implements, the BuilderRunOpts
// it carries, and the EmitOpts cross-cutting toggle bundle. These live in spec (not
// deploykit) because they are part of the E-envelope an out-of-process deploy/step
// plugin resolves against — EmitOpts.ParentExec threads a DeployExecutor through the
// nested-deploy tree, and the executor IMPLEMENTATIONS (sdk/kit) implement THIS
// interface. Homing them in spec keeps sdk/kit's own reverse-channel executor
// (kit.DeployExecutor, a DISTINCT interface) collision-free.
