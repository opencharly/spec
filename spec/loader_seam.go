// loader_seam.go — the hand-written CONTRACT types for the unified-config loader seam (K1/#46).
// These are interface + data contracts (no mechanism): the parse + walk machinery lives in
// sdk/loaderkit, and — since K1 unit 1 — the per-node kind-decode MATERIALIZE dispatch POLICY
// lives there too (Materializer below; the ACTUAL registry resolve + provider dispatch stays
// host-side, clause M, reached through MaterializeSeams exactly like WalkSeams above). They live
// in spec (the shared contract home, alongside the CUE-generated #ParsedProject / #LoadedProject
// wire types) so BOTH the loader plugin (candy/plugin-loader → loaderkit) and the host may
// reference them without either importing the other — charly core imports NEITHER loaderkit NOR
// any other sdk mechanism kit; it reaches the whole-project WALK exclusively through the typed
// ProjectWalker seam below, and the per-node MATERIALIZE exclusively through Materializer, both
// resolved from the registered compiled-in loader plugin (mirroring DocParser/Threaded for PARSE).

// Threaded is the host-computed, registry-derived DATA the per-document parse consults instead of
// querying the provider registry (boundary law clause D): which words are recognized kinds /
// deploy substrates, which external kinds may nest sub-entity members, and each plugin verb's
// scalar-sugar primary field. The host snapshots it before the parse; the parse never touches the
// registry.

	// descent stamp reads THIS registry-derived DATA snapshot instead of querying the provider
	// registry live, so the venue-hop descent stamp (loaderkit.StampBundleDescents) is registry-free
	// and can run plugin-side. The host fills it (deployTraitsFor per recognized kind/substrate word)
	// exactly as the former live stampBundleDescents did; a word absent from the map resolves to the

	// validator (loaderkit.ValidateCheckBeds) checks membership here instead of RECONSTRUCTING the
	// host's resourceKindSet ∧ externalizedDeploySubstrates ∧ recognizedDeploySubstrate decision —
