// VmDomainIdentity normalizes a deploy/bundle name into the per-deploy VM DOMAIN IDENTITY — the
// token that keys the libvirt domain (charly-<identity>), the per-domain state dir, the managed
// ssh-config alias, and the ssh-port ledger entry (vm:<identity>). It is DISTINCT from the kind:vm
// ENTITY (the disk/spec source, resolved via the deploy's `from:` cross-ref): several distinct beds
// may share one entity, so keying the domain by the ENTITY collided them on one libvirt domain +
// one disk + one host SSH port. Keying by the DEPLOY NAME instead makes distinct beds collision-free
// by construction (each gets its own domain, per-deploy disk overlay, and auto-allocated port).
//
// The normalization strips a leading "vm:" prefix and flattens the instance ("/") and nested-path
// (".") separators to "-", so a bare bed name maps to itself (check-builder-vm → check-builder-vm),
// a bundle ref maps to its VM token (vm:arch → arch), and a direct `charly vm create <entity>` (whose
// domain identity IS the entity) is unchanged. Both the host preresolver and candy/plugin-deploy-vm
// call this on the SAME deploy name, so the domain they derive always agrees.
//
// Home note (FLOOR-legal leaf): lives in package spec — the always-floor-legal
// wire/vocabulary leaf — so kernel-floor charly files (host_build_check_bed.go)
// derive the domain identity without a vmshared import. stdlib-only (strings).

// VmSshAlias returns the canonical managed-ssh-config Host alias for a VM deployment name

// `Host: VmSshAlias(id)` lets ssh(1) supply User/Port/IdentityFile. Pure naming leaf, a peer of
// VmDomainIdentity: lives in package spec — the always-floor-legal wire/vocabulary leaf — so the
// spec/exec executor-chain constructors (RootExecutorForDeployNode/ResolveDeployChain/
// VmChildExecutor) derive the alias without an sdk/kit import (#55 K4). sdk/kit re-exports it for

// helper handles the prefixed form (legacy refs + the "vm:<entity>" key the del path builds for
// ledger/teardown keying). The `instance` suffix is preserved for future per-instance addressing
// but currently unused. Relocated from sdk/vmshared (#55 vmshared Bucket B) so kernel-floor charly
